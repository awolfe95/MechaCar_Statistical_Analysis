## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

### Vehicle length and ground clearance (as well as intercept) provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset. 
### The slope of the linear model is considered to be zero because the intercept it statistically significant. 
### The linear model does predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively because the r-squared value is .71 and he p-value remained significant.
