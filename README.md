## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

* Vehicle length and ground clearance (as well as intercept) provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset. 
* The slope of the linear model is considered to be zero because the intercept it statistically significant. 
* The linear model does predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively because the r-squared value is .71 and he p-value remained significant. 

## Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils
* Currently, the design specification that the variance of suspension coils must not exceed 100 pounds per square inch is met in total because the total variance is 62.29. However, Lot 3 does not meet this specification because its variance is 170.29. Lots 2 and 3 do meet this specification.
